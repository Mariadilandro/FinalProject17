# FinalProject17
 
# Description:
  The plot of the game revolves around the idea of robbing a musuem. The player is being recruited by a world famous museum robber,
which happens to be the narrator, and is known for stealing the most extravagant pieces of history and art. In order to join the 
organization, the player is given a mission by the narrator of the game. The mission consists of having to steal four ancient and 
imporant jems. The player is in the museum after closing time and has to go through four different exhibits in order to obtain each 
gem. Each room consists of a different obstacle, including things such as invisible lasers and security guards. Throughout the 
game, the player has to make sure to answer trivia questions properly, as well as choose the correct secret numbers. If not done
properly, the player will lose. The player is also given a bag full of supplies that can help overcome obstacles. However, if the
player uses up all of one resource, then s/he will lose the game. The goal of the game is to try to get all four gems and escape 
the museum before the police catches the player. By completing the mission properly, the player will officially become a part of
the narrator's spy organization.

# Links to helpful resources:
1) http://introtopython.org/classes.html
   - This link was helpful to me because it included an example of a class and how to incorporate it in a function that will 
actually do something useful. The rocket example included in the source gives adequate detail as to how to set up the class for 
specific types of functions. 

2) https://gitpitch.com/UCMHS-Gerstein/IntrotoProgramming17/master?grs=github&t=black&p=Day30
  - This link was really helpful because it includes the class notes about the actual set up classes and object oriented
programming. I used this source to help refresh my knowledge of what each part of a class and its purpose. It allowed me to set
up a better rooms class for my game.

3) https://gitpitch.com/UCMHS-Gerstein/IntroToProgramming17/master?grs=github&t=black&p=Day11
  - This link incudes the class notes on while loops and for loops. This source was helpful for me because at first I was not sure
how to set up a function that would repeat until the player imputted the proper answer, but once I reread it, I was able to come
up with a while loop that goes along with my trivia questions and responses. 

4) https://gitpitch.com/UCMHS-Gerstein/IntrotoProgramming17/master?p=Day10
  - This source was definetly one of the most important ones for me because it included the definition and examples of if 
statements. I used this a lot in my code because I wanted to make sure the player was given the chance to have to think about
multiple decisions. This source refreshed my knowledge about if statements, which was really helpful.

  - This document I made on google docs includes an outline I used throughout my creation of the code. It is the file I used to
brainstorm my ideas, as well as organize how I will breakdown my code to make it easier to tackle. It includes a very basic idea
as to how the code will function.
